/// have `dur` rounded up to the nearest granularity of time they can sleep for.

/// without invoking the underlying [`nanosleep`] syscall, whereas on Windows
/// platforms the underlying [`Sleep`] syscall is always invoked.
/// If the intention is to yield the current time-slice you may want to use
/// [`yield_now`] instead.

/// A call to `park` does not guarantee that the thread will remain parked

/// process if the implementation encounters some rare errors).
///
/// # park and unpark
///
/// Every thread is equipped with some basic low-level blocking support, via the
/// [`thread::park`][`park`] function and [`thread::Thread::unpark`][`unpark`]
/// method. [`park`] blocks the current thread, which can then be resumed from
/// another thread by calling the [`unpark`] method on the blocked thread's
/// handle.
///
/// Conceptually, each [`Thread`] handle has an associated token, which is
/// initially not present:
///
/// * The [`thread::park`][`park`] function blocks the current thread unless or
///   until the token is available for its thread handle, at which point it
///   atomically consumes the token. It may also return *spuriously*, without
///   consuming the token. [`thread::park_timeout`] does the same, but allows
///   specifying a maximum time to block the thread for.
///
/// * The [`unpark`] method on a [`Thread`] atomically makes the token available
///   if it wasn't already. Because the token is initially absent, [`unpark`]
///   followed by [`park`] will result in the second call returning immediately.
///
/// In other words, each [`Thread`] acts a bit like a spinlock that can be
/// locked and unlocked using `park` and `unpark`.
///
/// Notice that being unblocked does not imply any synchronization with someone
/// that unparked this thread, it could also be spurious.
/// For example, it would be a valid, but inefficient, implementation to make both [`park`] and
/// [`unpark`] return immediately without doing anything.
///
/// The API is typically used by acquiring a handle to the current thread,
/// placing that handle in a shared data structure so that other threads can
/// find it, and then `park`ing in a loop. When some desired condition is met, another
/// thread calls [`unpark`] on the handle.
///
/// The motivation for this design is twofold:
///
/// * It avoids the need to allocate mutexes and condvars when building new
///   synchronization primitives; the threads already provide basic
///   blocking/signaling.
///
/// * It can be implemented very efficiently on many platforms.
